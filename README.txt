Programming Assignment #3: Toroidal Spiral Tube (Tube Shaded due)
Due Date: 10/28/16


Overview:
For this project, I completed all three phases for the toroidal spiral tube project.
For the first phase, I wrote an OpenGL program that draws the spine curve using the code and
calculations from section 2 of the document. For the second phase, I built and rendered a 
wire frame mesh with the calculations and code from section 3 in the document. For the third
phase, I used the Gauroud Shading method by replacing my vertex and fragment shaders. I then
found the surface normal attributes and added uniform variables for the Model-View and
Normal Matrices, the lighting information, and the material properties. I added in a way to
toggle back and forth from the wireframe and shaded meshes.
